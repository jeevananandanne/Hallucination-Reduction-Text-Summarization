 this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . 
 group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . 
 results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . 
 there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , 
 anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set - shifting .",0.2111,0.0203,0.1307,0.2111,0.1479

 this inconsistency may be explained by the influence of anxiety ( state and trait ) on the blood pressure response to stress . 
 therefore , this study sought to determine whether anxiety is associated with blood pressure response to cold pressor ( cp ) and anger recall ( ar ) stress tests in young healthy african americans . 
 modeling using state and trait anxiety revealed that state anxiety predicts systolic ( sbp ) and diastolic blood pressure dbp response to cp and ar ( p  0.02 ) . 
 interestingly , state anxiety predicted heart rate changes only to cp ( p < 0.01 ; p = 0.3 for ar ) .

 these fullerene derivatives were then tested for their ability to transfect cells grown in culture with dna carrying the green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) reporter gene . 
 statistically significant expression of gfp was observed for all forms of the c60 derivatives when used as dna vectors and compared to the ability of naked dna alone to transfect cells . 
 however , efficient in vitro transfection was only achieved with the two positively charged c60 derivatives , namely , an octa - amino derivatized c60 and a dodeca - amino derivatized c60 vector . 
 increased levels of cellular toxicity were observed for positively charged c60 vectors relative to the negatively charged and neutral vectors . 
 structural analyses using dynamic light scattering and optical microscopy offered further insights into possible correlations between the various derivatized c60 compounds , the c60 vector / dna complexes , their physical attributes ( aggregation , charge ) and their transfection efficiencies . 
 recently , similar gd@c60-based compounds have demonstrated potential as advanced contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . 
 thus , the successful demonstration of intracellular dna uptake , intracellular transport , and gene expression from dna using c60 vectors suggests the possibility of developing analogous gd@c60-based vectors to serve simultaneously as both therapeutic and diagnostic agents .",0.375,0.089,0.1562,0.3229,0.2581

" although visible light - polymerized acrylic resins have been used in removable partial dentures , it is not clear whether the presence of a metal framework could interfere with their polymerization , by possibly reflecting the light and affecting important properties , such as roughness and hardness , which would consequently increase biofilm accumulation . 
 the aim of this study was to compare the roughness and knoop hardness of a visible light - polymerized acrylic resin and to compare these values to those of water - bath- and microwave - polymerized resins , in the presence of a metal framework . 
 after processing , specimens were ground with 360 to 1000-grit abrasive papers in a polishing machine , followed by polishing with cloths and 1m diamond particle suspension .
