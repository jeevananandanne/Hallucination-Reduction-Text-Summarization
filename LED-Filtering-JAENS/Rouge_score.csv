" research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life . 
 previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients ; however , to date , no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd . 
 this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . 
 group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . 
 results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . 
 there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , 
 anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set - shifting . ",0.4095,0.1342,0.194,0.3362,0.3316

" molecular therapeutics for treating epidermal growth factor receptor-(egfr- ) expressing cancers are a specific method for treating cancers compared to general cell loss with standard cytotoxic therapeutics .   
 however , the finding that resistance to such therapy is common in clinical trials now dampens the initial enthusiasm over this targeted treatment .   
 yet an improved molecular understanding of other receptor tyrosine kinases known to be active in cancer has revealed a rich network of cross - talk between receptor pathways with a key finding of common downstream signaling pathways . 
 such cross talk may represent a key mechanism for resistance to egfr - directed therapy .   
 here we review the interplay between egfr and met and the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) tyrosine kinases , as well as their contribution to anti - egfr therapeutic resistance in the context of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck , a tumor known to be primarily driven by egfr - related oncogenic signals .

" objectives : the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of asymptomatic vertebral fractures on the quality of life in older women as part of the sao paulo ageing & health study.methods:this study was a cross - sectional study with a random sample of 180 women 65 years of age or older with or without vertebral fractures . 
 the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis was administered to all subjects . 
 anthropometric data were obtained by physical examination , and the body mass index was calculated . 
 lateral thoracic and lumbar spine x - ray scans were obtained to identify asymptomatic vertebral fractures using a semi - quantitative method.results:women with asymptomatic vertebral fractures had lower total scores [ 61.4(15.3 ) vs. 67.1(14.2 ) , p  =  0.03 ] and worse physical function domain scores [ 69.5(20.1 ) vs. 77.3(17.1 ) , p  =  0.02 ] for the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis compared with women without fractures . 
 the total score of this questionnaire was also worse in women classified as obese than in women classified as overweight or normal . 
 high physical activity was related to a better total score for this questionnaire ( p  =  0.01 ) . likewise , lower physical function scores were observed in women with higher body mass index values ( p<0.05 ) and lower physical activity levels ( p<0.05 ) . 
 generalized linear models with gamma distributions and logarithmic link functions , adjusted for age , showed that lower total scores and physical function domain scores for the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis were related to a high body mass index , lower physical activity , and the presence of vertebral fractures ( p<0.05).conclusion : vertebral fractures are associated with decreased quality of life mainly physical functioning in older community - dwelling women regardless of age , body mass index , and physical activity . 
 therefore , the results highlight the importance of preventing and controlling asymptomatic vertebral fractures to reduce their impact on quality of life among older women . ",0.4498,0.1616,0.1915,0.3587,0.2868

" purpose : to describe the technique of cryopreservation of corneal lenticules extracted after small incision refractive lenticule extraction ( relex smile ) and initial results of femtosecond laser intrastromal lenticular implantation for hyperopia.methods:lenticules were collected from patients undergoing relex smile for the correction of myopia and subjected to a tissue processing technique and cryopreservation . 
 these lenticules were subsequently used to treat 8 hyperopic eyes and 1 aphakic eye . 
 a femtosecond laser was used to create a pocket into each patient 's cornea , followed by implantation of a cryopreserved lenticule . 
 the patients were monitored through follow - up examinations for a mean 155.4 days ( 38310 days).results : the mean interval from storage of lenticules to removal from liquid nitrogen was 96 days ( range , 19178 days ) . 
 mean spherical equivalent of hyperopic eyes treated was + 4.50  1.1 diopter ( d ) . 
 mean keratometry and pachymetry changed from preoperative 43.9 d and 531.6 m to 47.4 d and 605.2 m , respectively , postoperatively . 
 mean residual spherical equivalent for hyperopic eyes was + 0.6 d and + 4.1 d for the aphakic eye .

 there has been a growing interest in the use of hiv and other sexually transmitted disease biomarkers as more valid measures of intervention impact in high hiv prevalence areas , particularly in sub - saharan africa . 
 we examine the challenges , benefits , and feasibility of including hiv and herpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv-2 ) biomarker data , with details about different data collection and disclosure methods from two adolescent prevention trials in kenya and zimbabwe . in kenya , 
 whole blood samples were collected using venipuncture ; adult guardians were present during biomarker procedures and test results were disclosed to participants and their guardians . in contrast , in zimbabwe , samples were collected using finger pricks for dried blood spots ( dbs ) ; guardians were not present during biomarker procedures , and results were not disclosed to participants and/or their guardians . in both countries , 
 prevalence in the study samples was low . 
 although the standard of care for testing for hiv and other sexually transmitted infections includes disclosure in the presence of a guardian for adolescents under age 18 , we conclude that more research about the risks and benefits of disclosure to adolescents in the context of a clinical trial is needed . 
 notably , current serological diagnosis for hsv-2 has a low positive predictive value when prevalence is low , resulting in an unacceptable proportion of false positives and serious concerns about disclosing test results to adolescents within a trial .

 although several of these pathogens are transmitted by blood - feeding arthropods , hiv is not .

 we consider the empirical evidence for arthropod transmission , and suggest that mechanical transmission has not evolved in hiv because such strains would induce a faster onset of aids during infection , which would thereby limit their ability to spread . on the other hand , it is not as clear why biological transmission has not occurred . 
 available data suggests that a lack of appropriate genetic variation in hiv is one explanation , but it is also possible that a conflict between natural selection occurring within and between infected individuals has prevented its evolution instead .

 although the biological effects of sun and ultraviolet ( uv ) exposure have been extensively investigated , the biological effect of nir radiation is still unclear . 
 we previously reported that nir as well as uv induces photoaging and standard uv - blocking materials , such as sunglasses , do not sufficiently block nir . 
 the objective of this study was to investigate changes in gene expression in three - dimensional reconstructed corneal epithelial tissue culture exposed to broad - spectrum nir irradiation to simulate solar nir radiation that reaches human tissues.materials and methodsdna microarray and quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to assess gene expression levels in a three - dimensional reconstructed corneal epithelial model composed of normal human corneal epithelial cells exposed to water - filtered broad - spectrum nir irradiation with a contact cooling ( 20c ) . 
 the water - filter allowed 1,0001,800 nm wavelengths and excluded 1,4001,500 nm wavelengths.resultsa dna microarray with > 62,000 different probes showed 25 and 150 genes that were up- or downregulated by at least fourfold and twofold , respectively , after nir irradiation . in particular , epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) was upregulated by 19.4-fold relative to control cells .

 this occurs by binding to several receptor subtypes , defined p2x / p2y , which are widespread in different tissues and simultaneously localized on multiple cells .

 the aim of this study was to investigate probable protective effect of the interaction between vagus nerve and melatonin after i / r.materials and methods : this study was performed in male rats that were divided into six groups . 
 cervical vagus nerve was cut bilaterally after induction of i / r and the right one was stimulated by stimulator . 
 melatonin or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally . 
 the stomach was removed for histopathological and biochemical investigations.results:a significant decrease in infiltration of gastric neutrophils and malondialdehyde ( mda ) level after i / r was induced by melatonin and was disappeared after vagotomy . 
 the stimulation of vagus nerve significantly enhanced these effects of melatonin . 
 however , a stimulation of vagus nerve alone increased neutrophils infiltration and mda level .

" psychiatric illnesses characterized by disorganized cognition , such as schizophrenia , have been described in terms of fragmentation and hence understood as reduction in functional brain connectivity , particularly in prefrontal and parietal areas . however , as graph theory shows , relatively small numbers of nonlocal connections are sufficient to ensure global coherence in the modular small - world network structure of the brain . 
 we reconsider fragmentation in this perspective . 
 computational studies have shown that for a given level of connectivity in a model of coupled nonlinear oscillators , modular small - world networks evolve from an initially random organization . here 
 we demonstrate that with decreasing connectivity , the probability of evolving into a modular small - world network breaks down at a critical point , which scales to the percolation function of random networks with a universal exponent of  = 1.17 . 
 thus , according to the model , local modularity systematically breaks down before there is loss of global coherence in network connectivity . 
 we , therefore , propose that fragmentation may involve , at least in its initial stages , the inability of a dynamically evolving network to sustain a modular small - world structure .

 while appendicitis in a patient who was previously diagnosed to have ileocaecal crohn 's may be managed with appendicectomy and ileocaecal resection , appendicectomy alone when performed for appendicitis in a patient with unsuspected ileocaecal crohn 's disease could lead to postoperative complications including enterocutaneous fistula.case report : a young female patient who underwent appendicectomy elsewhere for acute appendicitis presented to us with a persistent enterocutaneous fistula of 6 weeks duration .

" although several studies have shown that enhanced cardiovascular reactivity can predict hypertension development in african americans , these findings have not been consistent among all studies examining reactivity and hypertension susceptibility . 
 this inconsistency may be explained by the influence of anxiety ( state and trait ) on the blood pressure response to stress . 
 therefore , this study sought to determine whether anxiety is associated with blood pressure response to cold pressor ( cp ) and anger recall ( ar ) stress tests in young healthy african americans . 
 modeling using state and trait anxiety revealed that state anxiety predicts systolic ( sbp ) and diastolic blood pressure dbp response to cp and ar ( p  0.02 ) . 
 interestingly , state anxiety predicted heart rate changes only to cp ( p < 0.01 ; p = 0.3 for ar ) .

 to evaluate the correlation and reliability of cervical sagittal alignment parameters obtained from lateral cervical radiographs ( xrs ) compared with lateral whole - body stereoradiographs ( srs).methods 
 we evaluated adults with cervical deformity using both lateral xrs and lateral srs obtained within 1  week of each other between 2010 and 2014 . 
 xr and sr images were measured by two independent spine surgeons using the following sagittal alignment parameters : c2c7 sagittal cobb angle ( sca ) , c2c7 sagittal vertical axis ( sva ) , c1c7 translational distance ( c17 ) , t1 slope ( t1-s ) , neck tilt ( nt ) , and thoracic inlet angle ( tia ) . 
 pearson correlation and paired t test were used for statistical analysis , with intra- and interrater reliability analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc).results 
 a total of 35 patients were included in the study . 
 we found excellent intrarater reliability for all sagittal alignment parameters in both the xr and sr groups with icc ranging from 0.799 to 0.994 for xr and 0.791 to 0.995 for sr . 
 interrater reliability was also excellent for all parameters except nt and tia , which had fair reliability . 
 we also found excellent correlations between xr and sr measurements for most sagittal alignment parameters ; sca , sva , and c1c7 had r  >  0.90 , and only nt had r  <  0.70 .

" abstractthe incidence of pathological gambling in parkinson 's patients is significantly greater than in the general population . 
 a correlation has been observed between dopamine agonist medication and the development of pathological gambling . 
 however , scientists conjecture that the affected patients have underlying risk factors . studies analysing parkinson 's patients have detected that patients who developed pathological gambling are younger , score higher on noveltyseeking tests , are more impulsive and are more likely to have a personal or family history of alcohol addiction . 
 in addition , some genetic variations have been associated with the susceptibility of developing pathological gambling , which include mutations of drd3 , 5httlpr and grin2b . 
 studies focusing on neurofunctional discrepancies between parkinson 's patients with and without pathological gambling have found increased functional activation and dopamine release in regions associated with the mesolimbic reward system . 
 furthermore , there is also evidence showing increased processing of reward and decreased activation elicited by punishment , suggesting altered learning processes . 
 furthermore , the role of deep brain stimulation of the nucleus subthalamicus ( stn dbs ) is controversial . in most parkinson 's patients , 
 pathological gambling resolved after the initiation of the stn dbs , which might be explained by discontinuation or decrease in dopamine agonist medication .

" release and reception of extracellular atp by leukocytes plays a critical role in immune responses to infection , injury and cardiovascular disease . 
 leukocytes of both the innate , adaptive immune and central nervous system express a repertoire of cell surface receptors for atp ( p2x and p2y receptors ) and its metabolites . 
 atp acts as a damage - associated molecule pattern ( damp ) released by injured or dying cells . 
 detection of released atp by neighboring leukocytes initiates inflammation and wound healing . 
 however , recent evidence from our group and others suggests atp release by leukocytes themselves serves to regulate homeostatic mechanisms and coordinate responses to external pro - inflammatory cues . 
 examples include the homeostatic control of intracellular calcium and regulation of migratory guidance during chemotactic response to external cues .

 was impaired in dio c57bl/6j mice and improved with ilepatril or enalapril . 
 sensory nerve conduction velocity , thermal nociception , and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were impaired in dio c57bl/6j mice and improved with ilepatril or candoxatril . in the intervention study only enalapril improved glucose tolerance . sensory nerve conduction velocity and intraepidermal nerve fiber density 
 were improved by all three treatments , whereas thermal nociception was improved by ilepatril or candoxatril . in nep - deficient mice 
 dio impaired glucose utilization and this was improved with enalapril . 
 nerve function was not impaired by dio in nep - deficient mice . 
 these studies suggest that ace and nep play a role in pathophysiology associated with dio . ",0.4071,0.1378,0.1858,0.3805,0.2833
" first reported in 2003 , mosaic tetracycline resistance genes are a subgroup of the genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins ( rpps ) . 
 they are formed when two or more rpp - encoding genes recombine resulting in a functional chimera . to date , the majority of mosaic genes are derived from sections of three rpp genes , tet(o ) , tet(w ) and tet(32 ) , with others comprising tet(m ) and tet(s ) . in this first review of mosaic genes 
 , we report on their structure , diversity and prevalence , and suggest that these genes may be responsible for an under - reported contribution to tetracycline resistance in bacteria . ",0.3673,0.0619,0.1939,0.2959,0.249
" backgroundfollicular thyroid cancer ( ftc ) metastasizes most commonly to the lungs and non - cranial bones . 
 skull and skin are uncommon sites and usually manifest well after the diagnosis of primary malignancy . 
 metastasis to skull and skin as the presenting feature of ftc is infrequently reported in the literature.case presentationa 65-year - old caucasian woman with a history of thyroid nodule presented with the complaint of rapidly growing skull nodules which had been present for 3 years but were stable previously . 
 she denied any fevers , chills , history of trauma , or weight loss . 
 she denied any history of smoking or head and neck irradiation . on physical examination , 
 she had two non - tender gray cystic lesions  one on her left temporal region and the other on the right parietal region . 
 biopsy was consistent with metastatic ftc . 
 magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated 7.13.8 cm and 3.74.5 cm fairly homogeneous , enhancing , relatively well - defined masses centered in the posterior and left anterior lateral calvarium with intracranial and extracranial extensions but without any vasogenic edema or mass effect on the brain . 
 thyroid ultrasound showed numerous nodules in both lobes . 
 the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy . 
 histopathological studies of the thyroid gland revealed a well - differentiated ftc in the left lobe . 
 then she underwent resection of the tumor in multiple stages . 
 she did not have any recurrence of the ftc or metastases during the follow - up period and will be receiving radioactive iodine treatment.conclusionbone and lung are the common sites of metastasis from ftc , but involvement of skull or skin is unusual , particularly as the presenting feature . 
 metastases from ftc should be in the differential of patients with new osteolytic hypervascular skull lesions or cutaneous lesions in head and neck area . ",0.5513,0.3313,0.2978,0.5191,0.3541
" although visible light - polymerized acrylic resins have been used in removable partial dentures , it is not clear whether the presence of a metal framework could interfere with their polymerization , by possibly reflecting the light and affecting important properties , such as roughness and hardness , which would consequently increase biofilm accumulation . 
 the aim of this study was to compare the roughness and knoop hardness of a visible light - polymerized acrylic resin and to compare these values to those of water - bath- and microwave - polymerized resins , in the presence of a metal framework . 
 thirty - six specimens measuring 30.0  4.0  0.5 mm of a microwave- ( onda cryl ) , a visible light- ( triad ) and a water - bath- polymerized ( clssico ) ( control ) acrylic resins containing a cobalt - chromium metal bar were prepared . 
 after processing , specimens were ground with 360 to 1000-grit abrasive papers in a polishing machine , followed by polishing with cloths and 1m diamond particle suspension . roughness was evaluated using a profilometer ( surfcorder se 1700 ) and knoop hardness ( kg / mm2 ) was assayed using a microhardness tester ( shimadzu hmv 2000 ) at distances of 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 m from the metal bar . 
 roughness and knoop hardness means were submitted to two - way anova and compared by tukey and kruskal wallis tests at a 5% significance level statistically significant differences were found ( p<0.05 ) for roughness and knoop hardness , with light - polymerized resin presenting the highest values ( ra = 0.11 m and hardness between 20.2 and 21.4 kg / mm2 ) . 
 knoop values at different distances from the metal bar did not differ statistically ( p>0.05 ) . within the limitations of this in vitro study , it was concluded that the presence of metal did not influence roughness and hardness values of any of the tested acrylic resins .

" background : early detection of skin cancers by screening could be very beneficial to decrease their morbidity or mortality . 
 there is limited study about skin cancer screening in iran.aim:this essay was planned as a pilot skin cancer screening campaign in tehran , iran to evaluate its profit and failure and further design large - scale screening program more definitely.materials and methods : thirty one public health centers of shahid beheshti medical university were selected in different areas of tehran . 
 the project was announced via media and invited all the people above 40 years old to come for the whole - body skin examination in a one - week period . 
 patients with any suspected lesions were referred to the dermatology clinics of the university.results:1314 patients , 194 males ( 14.8% ) and 120 females ( 85.2% ) , with mean age of 51.81  10.28 years participated in this screening campaign . 
 physicians found suspected lesions in 182 ( 13.85% ) of participants . 
 the diagnosis of skin cancer was confirmed in 15 ( 1.14% ) patients . 
 these malignancies included 10 ( 0.76% ) cases of basal cell carcinoma , 2 ( 0.15% ) cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 3 ( 0.23% ) cases of malignant melanoma.conclusion:skin cancer screening seems to be valuable to detect skin malignancies in their early course . regarding the considerable amount of facilities needed to perform skin cancer screening program , it might be more beneficial to perform the targeted screening programs for the high - risk groups or emphasis more on public education of skin cancer risk factors and their early signs .

" vascular access is used as a lifeline for hemodialysis in patients with end stage renal disease failure ( esrd ) . 
 failure of arteriovenous fistula ( avf ) maturation is still high . 
 the purpose of this study was to research the effects of clopidogrel in combination with oral iloprost , a synthetic analog of prostacyclin pgi2 . 
 ninety - six diabetic esrd patients were divided into two groups . in the first group ( group 1 , n = 50 ) , clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily dose ) and an oral prostacycline analog ( 200 mg daily dose ) were administered . in the second group ( group 2 , n = 46 ) , placebo was given . 
 all patients took study medication 710 days prior to surgery . a doppler ultrasound ( usg ) 
 was performed for measurement of arterial and venous diameters , and peak systolic velocity of arterial flow based on subsequent fistula adequacy . 
 autogenous avfs were constructed in forearm as distally as possible in all patients . 
 both groups were followed - up for a year . in the placebo group , 
 early avf thrombosis was detected in two patients ( 4.3% ) . 
 avf maturation failure was noted in 14 patients ( 30.4% ) in placebo group and in four patients ( 8% ) in clopidogrel plus oral prostacycline analog group in the early postoperative period ( p = 0.001 ) . 
 the mean maturation time was 38  6.5 and 53  12.8 days in study and placebo groups , respectively ( p = 0.023 ) .

" objective : to elucidate the consequences of broadening dsm - iv criteria for generalized anxiety disorder ( gad ) , we examined prospectively the evolution of gad symptoms in two groups of patients ; one group diagnosed according to dsm - iv criteria and the other , according to broader criteria.method:multicentre , prospective and observational study conducted on outpatient psychiatric clinics . 
 patients were selected from october 2007 to january 2009 and diagnosed with gad according to dsm - iv criteria ( dsm - iv group ) or broader criteria . 
 broader criteria were considered 1-month of excessive or non - excessive worry and only 2 of the associated symptoms listed on dsm - iv for gad diagnosis . 
 socio - demographic data , medical history and functional outcome measures were collected three times during a 6-month period.results:3,549 patients were systematically recruited ; 1,815 patients in dsm - iv group ( dg ) and 1,264 in broad group ( bg ) ; 453 patients did not fulfil inclusion criteria and were excluded . 
 most patients ( 87.9% in dg , 82.0% in bg ) were currently following pharmacological therapies ( mainly benzodiazepines ) to manage their anxiety symptoms .

" renal clear cell carcinomas represent about 3% of all visceral cancers and account for approximately 85% of renal cancers in adults . 
 environmental and genetic factors are involved in the development of renal cancer . 
 although to date there are 19 hereditary syndromes described in which renal cell cancer may occur , only four syndromes with an unequivocal genetic predisposition to renal cell carcinoma have been identified : vhl syndrome ( mutations in the vhl gene ) , hereditary clear cell carcinoma ( translocations t(3:8 ) , t(2:3 ) ) , hereditary papillary carcinoma ( mutations in the met protooncogene ) and tuberous sclerosis ( mutations in the tsc1 and tsc2 genes ) . 
 little is known genetically about the other forms of familial renal cell cancer . since there is a growing awareness about the necessity of early intervention 
 , clinical criteria have been developed that aid in the identification of hereditary forms of renal cancer . 
 the aim of the current study was to identify minimal inclusion criteria so that nuclear pedigree families can be ascertained for risk assessment and/or kidney tumour screening . 
 the results reveal that inclusion features described herein , such as ( a ) renal clear cell cancer diagnosed before 55 years of age , and ( b ) renal clear cell cancer and gastric cancer or lung cancer among first degree relatives , are useful in identifying suspected hereditary clear cell renal cancer patients .
