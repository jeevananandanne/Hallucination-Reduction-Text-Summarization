# Hallucination-Reduction-Text-Summarization
In text summarization, hallucinations refer to the phenomena in which the model generates information that is neither present or supported by the input source document. The problem of hallucinations significantly impairs the accuracy and reliability of the generated summaries. The goal of this paper is to reduce hallucinations in long-form text texts. We used the PubMed dataset, which contains lengthy scientific research papers and their abstracts. To increase the performance of the generated summary and eliminate hallucinations, we applied approaches such as data filtering and joint entity and summary generation (JAENS) in the fine-tuning of the Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model.
